    "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a paradigm where models learn representations from unlabeled data by solving **pretext tasks**. The model generates its own supervision signal from the data structure itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Main Families of SSL:**\n",
    "1. **Generative/Predictive Methods**: Reconstruct or predict part of the input\n",
    "   - Examples: Autoencoders, masked language modeling (BERT), image inpainting\n",
    "   - Learns by minimizing reconstruction error\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Discriminative/Contrastive Methods**: Learn to distinguish between different views\n",
    "   - Examples: SimCLR, MoCo, SwAV\n",
    "   - Learns by pulling positive pairs together, pushing negatives apart\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Critical Thinking Question 1\n",
    "**Why might SSL be particularly valuable in domains like medical imaging or astronomy?**\n",
    "\n",
